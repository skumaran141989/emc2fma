                            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">During my days at UT Arlington, I had the opportunity to work with great professors like <strong>Dr. Ramez Elmasri</strong> and <strong>Dr. Manfred Huber</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Intent of this space:</strong></p>
                            <p>Given the phase of software engineering towards AI-reliance that led to new field of prompt engineering, there is misunderstanding of usage of AI - technology should augement humans rather suppress thinking and learning.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><strong>Core Philosophy:</strong></p>
                            <p>Languages are communication tools and DSA defines the efficiency for using the tool. The core of software evolution was hands-on research.</p>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We were able to build Chat-GPT, Claude or an AI via manual coding, thinking with human emotions, solving on-line real-time issues with temperament.</p>

                                <li>Showcase <strong>products</strong> built following software engineering skills and good research</li>
                                <li>Share knowledge based on research via experiments covering <strong>DSA</strong>, <strong>Languages</strong>, and <strong>System Architecture/Design</strong> at an in-depth level</li>
