                        <h3>Research Overview</h3>
                        <p>My academic research was focused on practical applications of computer science principles, with emphasis on cloud computing, Machine Learning. </p>
                        <p>I was part of LEARN and MAST lab in UT Arlington.</p>

                            <li>Overall Storm Identification</li>
                            <p>I had implemented a Map-Reduce alogorithm on Hadoop to create storm tragectory from hourly storms, consolidated from historical raw rainfall data recorded over years</p>
                            
                            <li>Master Thesis - A Storm Targectory Prediction Model using HMM</li>
                                
                             <p>This project focused on building a model for predicting the directional and spatial movement of overall storm trajectories using Markov property. We develop a Markov Model from the given set of overall storm trajectories and extend it to the Hidden Markov Model, which is then improvised using a learning algorithm called Baum-welch.</p>
